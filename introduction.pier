!! Introduction

*Pillar>http://www.smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Pier/Pillar* is a markup syntax and associated tools to write and generate documentation and books.

Pillar is currently used to write the *Enterprise Pharo book>https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/job/PharoForTheEnterprise*
and other projects.

The Pillar screenshot below (see Figure *voyageDocExample*) shows a part of the *Voyage documentation>https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/PharoForTheEnterprise-english/blob/master/Voyage/Voyage.pier* generated by Pillar.

- customization of the export through a dedicated STON configuration file

- syntax-highlighting of generated code blocks (not yet in LaTeX)
- configurable numbering of section titles and figures
- ...

Pillar has also:
- a 5-minutes tutorial
